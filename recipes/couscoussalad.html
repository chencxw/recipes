        <p>This is one of my absolute favourite recipe. It's couscous salad with avocado and corn. It's easy to make and pairs well with any dish!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

            <li>15 oz can corn</li>
            <li>1 avocado</li>
            <li>1/4 cup balsamic vinaigrette</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>fresh basil</li>
        </ul>
